    1. Add pointer type class .done
    2. Add expression classes: PtrAddExpr IntToPtrExpr PtrToIntExpr (PrtDiffExpr)
    3. Update parser to generate the expressions. Only the encoder should complain at this step.
    4. Update expression encoder
    5. Update property encoder

    





NOTES:
    PtrBinaryOp is problematic as pointer diff can be undefined
    Pointed comparaison should be added anyway


Int to pointer during the encoding only
